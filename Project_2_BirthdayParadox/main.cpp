This source code file is related to the solving of the following project:
    
Book:           The Big Book of Small Python Projects
Project #:      1
Project Title:  Bagels

Description:
    This is to be a game where a random set of 3 numbers is generated, i.e
    123 or 456 and the user has 10 attempts to guess the numbers. Upon each guess
    the program will respond with "pico" when the guess has the correct digit but 
    in the wrong place, "Fermi" when the guess has a correct digit in the proper place
    and "Bagels" when the guess has no correct digits.
